When the user opens the app in a browser, they will see a page with a question that asks them if they would like to take the quiz. When the guiz starts, a timer will start counting down. The goal is to asnswer the questions as quickly and accurately as possible. After all the questions have been answered, the timer will stop and the remaining time will be the user's final score.
